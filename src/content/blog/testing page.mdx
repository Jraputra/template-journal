# The Nature of Practice

In my journey with meditation, I've found that the most profound insights often come from the simplest practices[^1]. The breath, for instance, serves as our constant companion - a bridge between the conscious and unconscious aspects of our being. Through careful observation of the breath, we begin to understand the nature of impermanence and the subtle workings of our mind[^2].

## Stages of Practice

The development of meditation practice often follows distinct stages, though not always in a linear fashion. In the Theravada tradition, these stages are well-documented through the Progress of Insight[^3]. However, it's crucial to remember that maps are not the territory - they serve as guides rather than absolute truths.

[^1]: This insight comes primarily from the teachings of Leigh Brasington and his work on the jhanas.
[^2]: The Buddha himself used the breath as the primary object of meditation, as documented in the Anapanasati Sutta.
